# SVM-Support-Vector-Machine-
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence, which allows the computer to operate in a self-learning mode, without being explicitly programmed. It is a very interesting and complex topic, which could drive the future of technology.

There are copious applications of Machine learning, out of which Image Classification is one. To classify images, here we are using SVM. Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language and Support vector machine(SVM) is subsumed under Scikit-learn.


“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In this SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well.
